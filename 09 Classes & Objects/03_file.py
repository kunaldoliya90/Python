# 9.3
# Write a Python class Employee with attributes like emp_name, emp_id,
# emp_salary, emp_department and methods like calculate_salary, and
# print_details. Use 'calculate_salary' method takes two arguments: salary
# and hours_worked. If the number of hours worked is more than 50, the
# method computes overtime and adds it to the salary. Overtime is
# calculated as following formula:
# overtime = hours_worked â€“ 50
# overtime amount = (overtime * (salary / 50))
# Use 'print_details' method to print the details of employee. Consider the
# sample data:
# "Adams " "E7876" 50000 "Accounting"
# "Jones" "E7499" 45000 "Research"
# "Martin" "E7900" 50000 "Sales"
# "Smith" "E7698" 55000 "Operations"

# Example usage
print("Employee Details:")
